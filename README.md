Concept
Local places finder that will show a map based on a location a user searches for. It will utilize the Google Maps API to display the map and include markers for nearby restaurants that match the user's search preferences (bar, restaurant, museum, etc.). There will be a second API (Open Weather Map API) that will also display the current weather conditions based on the location in the map. The js library we will be using is Algolia places. It works with user input to search and suggest addresses based on that input. That will help the user to suggest a location when they're typing in their input.

Once the user enters in the location to search for, a map will display centered on that location. The weather for that area will also display below the map. The user can then filter results based on various criteria. The filters will show below the map. Below the filters will be dynamic content that will populate based on the filters and map location. The user can cross off or favorite results, which that information will be saved to local storage so that the site will remember their choices.
